# ENGL-3695-Final-Project
For this project, I'd like to draw upon my background as a someone who has studied History and Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies. Literature is largely up to the interpretation of every reader. I’d like to explore how these interpretations can change when the element of computer analysis and algorithms present literature in a new light.

I will use Max Woolf's lab in order to train a model to generate text based on Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. I will use this model to generate copious amounts of text about women that I will further analyze. I will use POS tagging and frequency distributions to extract most common information, such as adjectives and verbs, to understand context in which women are written about.
