# ENGL-3695-Final-Project
For this project I'd like to draw upon my background as a someone who has studied History and Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies. In my personal research and work, I've explored the significance of oral histories via interviews and the role that bias can have in analyzing the content of the work.  This project seeks to explore the role of gender in the lives of two formerly enslaved people, Harriet A. Jacobs and Frederick Douglass. In order to minimize the presence of bias from white historians and others, I have chosen to use their autobiographical texts available from the Project Gutenberg corpus.
